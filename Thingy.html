      <h5>Description, June 23, 2019</h5>

      <p><font color=red face="Comic Sans MS" class=owo>The disciples Goat Boi and Emeraldgreenfish (Emerald / Emi) were in a call. They were in the presence of the One True God Haawwkeye, but not physically, as he is omnicient, omnipotent and omnipresent. The disciple Goat Boi had experienced a vision - an epiphany. He said to Emeraldgreenfish, whose phone had just vibrated, "Hawk vibrated you." <br> This is the Hawkanic equivalent to the Christian "peace be with you". At this moment, Emeraldgreenfish realised her true calling - to write the Holy Bibles of Hawkanity. She laughed out of pure joy and satisfaction (because she had just realised her life calling). These individuals were lucky enough to be very close to the God Haawwkeye in his time on Earth. She immediately went to tell the God of her new-found belief in him. He continued his godly vibrations from on high, and simply said, "I mean ... I would..." <br> Emeraldgreenfish had recieved the highest blessing from Haawwkeye - the utmost grace from God.</font></p>

      <p><font color=red face="Comic Sans MS" class=owo>The group of Shipping Friends (since 1969) gathered in a dark room. Not all of the members could attend this certain meeting, since it was late - very late. Eipc, Goat Boi, Emeraldgreenfish and our Lord Haawwkeye were all gathered together in the room, discussing the significance of Goat Boi's vision. <br> Eipc too had now discovered his/her beliefs, and was sharing the Holy Hawkanic Meeting with the current members. They were getting absolute kicks out of their ignorance of the truth, beforehand. Goat Boi once again prophecised the coming of Haawwk to judge the population. Goat Boi also discussed with Emi the meaning of her special grace. He said "You can play Blox Saber and I can't... because I don't have Haawwk to vibrate me". The group laughed and conversed until Goat Boi had to take his leave. Then the remaining members dropped the topic of Hawkanity and just let it remain in their hearts whilst they talked.</font></p>
      <br>
	  <h2>Book 3</h2>
      <h5>Description, June 23, 2019</h5>

      < !-- <p>Some text..</p> --
      <p><font color=red face="Comic Sans MS" class=owo>Goat Boi  and Emeraldgreenfish, led by Haawwkeye (the God), iniciated the preaching and spreading of the word about the Hawkanic church. The trio began to spread the word on all of their servers, and they preached all day to their audiences about the vibrations from the Holy Lord Haawwkeye. And all through this time they felt a vacant space in their hearts because of the lack of vibrations. So, looking up to the God Haawwkeye, they offered up their prayers and asked for more vibrations. This teaches us the lesson of how to pray to the God Haawwkeye.</font></p>

      <h2>Book 4</h2>
      <h5>Description, September 2, 2019</h5>
      < !-- <div class="fakeimg">Fake Image</div> --
      < !-- <p>Some text..</p> --
      <p><font color=red face="Comic Sans MS" class=owo>Haawwkeye had begun to show himself more in public. The people knew him as a good man and a perfect example of holiness. Then on one of the days where Haawwk was walking down the road to [insert place here] (and no, it wasn't Damascus), he saw a blind man. And the man called out to him - 
"My God, My Lord! Haawwkeye please heal me!"
Haawwkeye crossed the sidewalk over to where the man was and crouched beside him. He looked into the man's eyes:
"By the power of the Haawwk, the Haawwkeye and the Hawk, may the vibrations heal your blindness!"
And at once, the man stood up and took a first confident step. He hugged our Lord, and thanked him. Then, he began to run He ran right into the middle of the road and got hit by a truck.
Those who never saw never will see, I guess.
Moral: Don't be a dumb healed blind man.</font></p>
